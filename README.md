- This repository explains exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Iris Flower Dataset.  
- With the help of this project we can classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width.    
- The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  

## Description
- The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)  
- In this project I have used Pandas library for loading dataset, and "data analysis" such as data cleaning, data wrangling.  
- In this project I have used Numpy librabry for "numerical analysis".  
- In this project I have used Matplotlib library for "plotting" and Seaborn library for "visualization".  

## Dataset
- Dataset can be obtained from Kaggle through this link: [Kaggle Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)  
- The dataset can also be obtained from my repository.
